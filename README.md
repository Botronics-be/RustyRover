* Showcase how using [Pixi](https://pixi.prefix.dev/latest/) eases the creation, versionning and dependencies of ROS2 workspaces 
* Getting your feet wet on the [rclrs](https://github.com/ros2-rust/ros2_rust) rust ROS2 client library on a practical case, showcasing the maturity of rclrs by using most of the ROS2 utilities (topics publishers/subscribers, services servers and client, actions).
